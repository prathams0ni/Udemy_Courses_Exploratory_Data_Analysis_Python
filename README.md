## 📌 Project Overview
Online learning platforms like Udemy offer thousands of courses across different subjects, price ranges, and difficulty levels.  
Understanding how pricing, content structure, and other factors impact enrollments is crucial for instructors and businesses.

This project performs a **comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Udemy course data to uncover meaningful patterns and insights that can support data-driven decisions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
The main goals of this project are to:
- Explore and understand the Udemy courses dataset
- Clean and preprocess raw course data
- Analyze the relationship between course price and enrollments
- Categorize courses into meaningful price bands
- Generate insights that can help optimize course pricing and content strategy

---

## 📂 Dataset Information
- **Dataset Name:** Udemy Courses Dataset
- **Source:** Public Udemy course data
- **File Used:** `udemy_courses.csv`
- **Key Columns:**
  - Course title
  - Subject / category
  - Price
  - Number of subscribers (enrollments)
  - Number of lectures
  - Content duration
  - Course level

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing
The following preprocessing steps were performed:
- Removed irrelevant and duplicate records
- Handled missing and inconsistent values
- Converted data types where required
- Created price bands for better comparison
- Generated clean, analysis-ready datasets

📁 Cleaned outputs:
- `clean_udemy.csv`
- `median_enrollments_by_price_band.csv`

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key analyses performed include:
- Distribution of course prices
- Enrollment trends across different price ranges
- Median enrollments by price band
- Relationship between course structure (lectures & duration) and popularity
- Identification of high-performing pricing segments

Visualizations were created using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to support insights.

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Lower-priced and free courses generally attract higher enrollments
- Certain mid-range price bands show strong median enrollments
- Course content structure influences learner engagement
- Price alone is not the only factor; course quality indicators matter

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 📈 Future Scope
- Build a predictive model to estimate enrollments
- Perform topic-wise or subject-wise analysis
- Create an interactive dashboard using Power BI or Tableau
- Apply clustering to group similar courses

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how **exploratory data analysis** can convert raw data into actionable insights.  
The findings can help instructors and platforms make informed decisions about pricing, content planning, and course design.
